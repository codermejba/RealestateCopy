# 🏡 Real Estate Landing Page — Hously Clone (React + Bootstrap 5)

This project is a pixel-perfect clone of the **Hously Landing Page (index-six)**, originally built with Tailwind CSS. I rebuilt it using **React**, **Bootstrap 5**, and **styled-components** to sharpen my frontend development skills and gain real experience in layout replication, component structuring, and responsive design.
