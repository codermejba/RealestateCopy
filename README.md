# Real Estate Landing Page Clone

This project is a clone of the **Hously Landing Page (index-six)**, originally built using Tailwind CSS. I rebuilt it using **React**, **Bootstrap 5**, and **styled-components** to enhance my frontend development skills and gain experience with layout replication and responsive design.
